<h1 id="casting"><b>BREAKING: Donald Glover Cast As Young Lando Calrissian In Han Solo 'A Star Wars Story' Film</b></h1>

<p>
Big news just broke regarding the upcoming young Han Solo film! A few months back rumors surfaced that suggested that actor and musician Donald Glover was being considered for the role of young Lando Calrissian in the film.

<p>
Just moments ago, Lucasfilm announced that Glover has been cast in the role and will star alongside Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo in the film, which is due for release in 2018.

<p>
Glover has worked as a writer for the NBC comedy Rockefeller Plaza (2006) which he also got a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for in 2009. He is perhaps best known for his role as Troy on the comedy series Community (2009) in which he played an athlete in a rather odd study group, opposite Chevy Chase and Joel McHale.
<p>
On behalf of Star Wars fans everywhere, I would like to welcome Mr. Glover to the Star Wars family!
<p>
The Force will be with him... always.
<p>
The untitled Han Solo "A Star Wars Story" film is currently set for release on May 25th, 2018!

<h1 id="interviews"><b>Mads Mikkelsen Compares His 'Rogue One' and 'Doctor Strange' Characters</b></h1>
<p>
<b>By: Benjamin Hart</b>
<p>
The cast of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is chock full of some major talent, including the increasingly well know Mads Mikkelsen. 2016 has been a huge year for the Danish actor, who not only plays Galen Erso, the father of Jyn, in Rogue One, but is also portraying the villain Kaecilius in Marvel's newest blockbuster Doctor Strange.
<p>
In a new interview with Yahoo Movies, Mikkelsen was asked to compare Galen and Kaecilius in regards to which would win in a fight and who he would rather have a drink with. You can hear his answers in the video below:

<h1 id="spoilers"><b>‘Star Wars’ Han Solo Movie: 5 Possible Spoilers</b></h1>
<p>
<b>By Robert Yaniz Jr </b>
<p>
This year’s film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will mark the first Star Wars film to take the saga into anthology territory. But while fans are busy contemplating what the Gareth Edwards film will contribute to the franchise, they’re also keeping an eye out for the latest scoop about the next standalone release in the queue, namely the upcoming film centering on a young Han Solo. We’ve gradually heard new bits of information on the film — which will be directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street, The Lego Movie) and star Alden Ehrenreich (Hail, Caesar!) as the scruffy looking nerf herder himself, as he steps into the iconic shoes of Harrison Ford.
<p>
However, for all the news that has been leaked, very little remains official in regard to the upcoming Han Solo film, which doesn’t even have a title yet. Today, we’re going to review some of the most promising rumors about the film. How much of the below is true remains to be seen, and it may contain possible spoilers. If you’re dead-set on remaining 100% spoiler-free, perhaps it’s better if you check out one of our other Star Wars articles.
<p>
Still with us? All right, let’s jump into hyperspace and get started.
<p>
<h3>1. Alden Ehrenreich could first appear in Rogue One</h3>
<img src="http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Felicity-Jones-in-Rogue-One-Lucasfilm.jpg" alt="Yummy" width="60%" align="center">
<p>
The exact time in which the Han Solo film will be set remains a mystery, but it’s certainly before he meets up with Luke and Obi-Wan at the cantina. That means there’s a very strong possibility that Ehrenreich could actually debut as the character in Rogue One, as rumors indicate. The timeline fits with both films, but even better, the appearance of Han in Rogue One would allow Lucasfilm to create the same kind of shared universe storytelling that has worked so well for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
<p>
<h3>2. Lando Calrissian will play a pivotal role</h3>
<img src="http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lando-Calrissian-Star-Wars.jpg" alt="Yummy" width="60%" align="center">
<p>
We already know that Chewbacca (naturally) will be a big part of the Han Solo film. That means that moviegoers are likely to see how the duo get their hands on the Millennium Falcon. Longtime fans know that this means a friendly wager or two with Lando Calrissian.
<p>
A casting call is reportedly already afoot to find an actor who can match Billy Dee Williams’s swagger in the role, and Community star Donald Glover might be close to landing the part. [Update, 10/27/16: Donald Glover has been chosen to play young Lando Calrissian in the standalone Han Solo movie!]
<p>
It’s unclear at this point how much screen time Lando will have in the film if these reports pay off, but it feels right to include Han’s on-again, off-again friend into the mix. He’s a wild card who could alternate between fighting alongside Han and getting him in even more trouble.
<p>
<h3>3. It will set up a Boba Fett spinoff</h3>
<img src="http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Boba-Fett.jpg" alt="Yummy" width="60%" align="center">
<p>
As soon as the prospect of Star Wars spinoff films were announced, fans were quick to make their desire for a Boba Fett film known. As it turns out, such a project has been heavily rumored for a while, and in keeping with the possibility of a Han Solo cameo in Rogue One, it makes sense for Lucasfilm to use a Han Solo film to tease what Boba Fett could be up to in his own adventure. Of course, that’s assuming that the bounty hunter’s film will take place around the same time. Many fans still want to see him escape the Great Pit of Carkoon, restoring that bit of the now lost canon that revealed he lived beyond Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. In any case, the idea of Boba Fett hunting down smugglers like Han, Chewie, and Lando is incredibly exciting.
<p>
<h3>4. A notable actress could be joining the cast</h3>
<p>
<img src="http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tessa-Thompson-in-Creed.jpg" alt="Yummy" width="60%" align="center">
<p>
While the original trilogy offers the potential for plenty of early adventures for Han and his friends, what his previous appearances didn’t do was establish the presence of a young woman in his life. Since the spinoff film is set long before Han meets Leia, the project must turn to another lead (more on her in a moment). Such popular actresses as Tessa Thompson (Creed), Zoe Kravitz (Mad Max: Fury Road), and Naomi Scott (the upcoming Power Rangers reboot) are reportedly testing for the role. Seeing as Thompson is the best known of the bunch and landed a plum role in Thor: Ragnarok (another Disney-owned property), we can see her edging out the competition.
<p>
<h3>5. Sana Solo will be the female lead</h3>
<p>
<img src="http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sana-Solo.jpg" alt="Yummy" width="60%" align="center">
<p>
About that female lead for the Han Solo film. Smart money is on that character being Sana Starros aka Sana Solo, Han’s (sort-of) wife. The pair have a contentious relationship, to say the least, but that’s why we think adding the fiery figure to the cast of the film could make for some interesting banter and action.
<p>
Sana is a recent addition to the canon, having only appeared in a Star Wars Marvel comic last year. Since Disney took over though, that’s all canon, and this is the perfect chance for Lucasfilm to prove that all these stories are connected.
